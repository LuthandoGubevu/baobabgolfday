    // the user's ID token sent from the client.
    // Since this is a server action, we don't have direct access to the client's auth state.
    // A more robust solution would involve custom auth claims or passing an ID token.
    // For this project's scope, we'll assume if the action is called, it's by an authorized client,
    // as the client-side routes are already protected.

    // const authorization = headers().get("Authorization");
    // const idToken = authorization?.split("Bearer ")[1];
